# plenoptomos

Plenoptic imaging reconstruction tools, developed in the context of the VOXEL
project, part of the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation
programme (VOXEL H2020-FETOPEN-2014-2015-RIA  GA 665207).

It provides a Python package that allows to read and manipulate light-field images.
The provided features are:
* support for a few types of datasets and formats (including the .vox format).
* support for refocusing using standard algorithms like the integration and Fourier methods.
* support for GPU accelerated tomography based refocusing, including the following algorithms:
  * unfiltered back-projection
  * SIRT
  * Chambolle-Pock (Least-square, TV)
* support for depth estimation

* Free software: GNU General Public License v3
